    <h3> Interphase: <p>Interphase is part of the whole cell cycle. Before going into the process of mitosis, the cell has to go through Interphase. Interphase is the process is in which the  cell spends ost of its time. In this phase, the cell grows but does not divide. Inside of Interphase occurs another phase known as Growth Phase or G1. </p></h3>
