    <h3> Interphase: <p>Interphase is part of the whole cell cycle. Before going into the process of mitosis, the cell has to go through Interphase. Interphase is the process in which the  cell spends most of its time. In this phase, the cell grows but does not divide. Inside of Interphase occurs another phase known as Growth Phase or G1. G1 Phase is the longest phase inside of Interphase. Here is where there is the reproduction of extra organelles such as ribosomes and proteins. Proteins are made until you get to the point of call division.The cell has a choice if it wants to continue growing and move towards the direction of cell division. If the cell continues, it moves to another phase knwn as "S phase" also known as DNA synthesis.This is where DNA replication occurs.   </p></h3>
