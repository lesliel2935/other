    <h3> Interphase: <p>Interphase is part of the whole cell cycle. Before going into the process of mitosis, the cell has to go through Interphase. Interphase is the process in which the  cell spends most of its time. In this phase, the cell grows but does not divide. Inside of Interphase occurs another phase known as Growth Phase or G1. G1 Phase is the longest phase inside of Interphase. Here is where there is the reproduction of extra organelles such as ribosomes and proteins. Proteins are made until you get to the point of call division.The cell has a choice if it wants to continue growing and move towards the direction of cell division.If the cell continues, it moves to another phase knwn as "S phase" also known as DNA synthesis.This is where DNA replication occurs. The 23 pairs of chromosomes are taken and duplicated which then become 46. The same way the cell has a choice to move to G1, it can chose to go to a phase known as G 0. If the cell enters the G 0 phase, there is no cell division, no more growth. It's known as the end point. If the cell enter the "S phase" and wants to further continue, it will enter another phase called "G2 Phase" which is another growth phase. In this stage, the cell prepares for mitosis. In order to prepare for mitosis, the cell makes microtubules.    </p></h3>

    <h3>Cell Cycle Control: <p> In order for the cell cycle to occur, there has to be certain requierements that have to be met. There are two key places where there is extensive regulation. The first key place is between G1 and S Phase. Regulation occurs here before it gets to DNA replication. The second place where extensive regulation occurs is between G2 and the step before mitosis. There are proteins that regulate this process. The first protein is called cyclin-dependent Kinases(addition of phosphate group to other enzymes or proteins to either activate or inactivate them).
