    <h3> Interphase: <p>Interphase is part of the whole cell cycle. Before going into the process of mitosis, the cell has to go through Interphase. Interphase is the process in which the  cell spends most of its time. In this phase, the cell grows but does not divide. Inside of Interphase occurs another phase known as Growth Phase or G1. G1 Phase is the longest phase inside of Interphase. Here is where there is the reproduction of extra organelles such as ribosomes and proteins. Proteins are made until you get to the point of call division.The cell has a choice if it wants to continue growing and move towards the direction of cell division.If the cell continues, it moves to another phase knwn as "S phase" also known as DNA synthesis.This is where DNA replication occurs. The 23 pairs of chromosomes are taken and duplicated which then become 46. The same way the cell has a choice to move to G1, it can chose to go to a phase known as G 0. If the cell enters the G 0 phase, there is no cell division, no more growth. It's known as the end point. If the cell enter the "S phase" and wants to further continue, it will enter another phase called "G2 Phase" which is another growth phase. In this stage, the cell prepares for mitosis. In order to prepare for mitosis, the cell makes microtubules.    </p></h3>

    <h3>Prophase
    <p> Early Phosphase: In this phase the cell starts to break some structures, but also build structures to get ready for dividing chromosomes.The chromosomes start to get smaller since it will be easier to split up. This is when the mitotic spindle starts to form. Microtubules is a strong fiber that is part of the cell skeleton which is the stucture of the spindle. The nuleolus is a sign that the nucleus is ready to break down <br> Late phophase: In this phase the mitotic spindle starts to capture and organize the chromosomes. Since all the chromosomes finish condensing they are compactful. The chromosomes start to release when the nuclear envelope breaks down. Now the microtubules captures more chromosomes and the mitotic spindle grows even more.

    <h3>Metaphase: <p> In metaphase, the spindle has captured all the chromosomes and lined them up in the middle of the cell.They are ready to divide. The chromosomes don't just align where ever. They align at the metaphase plate</p></h3>

    <h3>Cell Cycle Control: <p> In order for the cell cycle to occur, there has to be certain requierements that have to be met. There are two key places where there is extensive regulation. The first key place is between G1 and S Phase. Regulation occurs here before it gets to DNA replication. The second place where extensive regulation occurs is between G2 and the step before mitosis. There are proteins that regulate this process. The first protein is called cyclin-dependent Kinases(addition of phosphate group to other enzymes or proteins to either activate or inactivate them).These cyclin-dependent Kinases will work together with a protein/proteins called cyclins. It's important to know that these cyclin-dependent Kinases also known as CDK's are always present. All the different types are to be present in the cell but their default form/function is for them to be inactive. For this reason, they are activated by these cyclin proteins. The point of regulation here is that specific cycling are made at specific times. When you have a cyclin-dependent Kinase, it only activates when its bounded to a specific cyclin. At this point, the activation has occured  and the CDK is the end. This is the reason why there is the production of cyclins D and E in the G1 phase.Further on, you will see CDK-2 bound to the cyclin E that was produced.  In addition to this, the CDK-4 will bound to cyclin D. These activated Kinases, especially CDK-4, will phosphoralyte a protein known as "RB". If RB gets phosphorylated, it will not be able to inhibit DNA replication. The phosphate group makes it inactive. Further on, in S phase, cyclin A is produced. When it is produced, cyclin A will bound with CDK-2 to activate DNA replication. Only in the G2 phase is cyclin B produced because the cyclin B CDK-1 complex is able to activate cell division (Mitosis). After all, in order for extenive regulation to ocurr in thw two key places (between G1 and S Phase & between G2 and step before mitosis), there has to be cyclin proteins present s they can go and inhibit proteins blocking DNA replication from happening.        </p></h3>
